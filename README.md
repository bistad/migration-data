  mention that they are only ‘a technology company that does not provide or engage in 
  transportation services’. It further mentions that ‘the company is not a transportation
  provider’.These statements make it easier for them to shirk responsibility. Also, 
  it does not make them liable for the insurance of the rider or the passenger in case
  of an accident. As a service provider, ensuring the safety of customers should 
  be any company’s top priority—especially in the business of transportation.']},
