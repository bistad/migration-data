Tootle and Pathao are popular services that have made the lives of capital residents much easier by providing a middle-ground option for commuters: more comfortable than public transportation and more affordable than taxis. It is much easier to get in touch with a rider using an app on their phone, hop in, and get to the destination relatively faster and at a much cheaper rate. At the same time, these ride-hailing services are providing employment opportunities to many in the city."]}, {"ID": "48V40P27K7", "age": 29, "gender": "male", "profession": {"major": "Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance Occupations", "branch": "Pesticide Handlers, Sprayers, and Applicators, Vegetation"}, "interest": "music", "home_address": {"province": "PN4", "district": "Parbat", "MCP": "Maha Shila RM", "ward": "Ward 2"}, "foreign_address": {"country": "Congo-[DRC]", "ID": "CD", "lat": "-19.015438", "lon": "29.154857", "city": "Richmond Hill"}, "date_out": "2015.10.30", "date_return": "2019.8.30", "fund2invest": {"invetsment sector": "3%", "tourism and hospitality": "10%", "animal husbandary": "1%", "infrastructure": "3%", "cottage industries": "9%", "personal service business": "1%", "retail business": "10%", "consultancy service": "2%", "alternative energy": "9%", "agriculture": "6%", "total_fund": 6289}, "remittance": [{"month": 3, "amount": 390}, {"month": 12, "amount": 617}, {"month": 12, "amount": 561}, {"month": 2, "amount": 968}], "travell": [{"date": "2013.1.28", "place": {"country": "Greenland", "city": "NUUK (GODTHAB)"}}, {"date": "2012.6.15", "place": {"country": "Taiwan", "city": "FUNAFUTI"}}, {"date": "2016.6.10", "place": {"country": "Mauritius", "city": "Vacoas - Phoenix"}}], "social_work": [{"date": "2009.6.4", "work": "donation for school"}, {"date": "2002.7.28", "work": "creating employment"}, {"date": "2009.10.14", "work": "help for disable person"}], "personal_view": ["To add to the erroneous logic, Kathmandu Metropolitan City also recently issued a \u2018crackdown on litter-bugs\u2019\u2014if officials find people throwing any form of waste on the city\u2019s roads, they will be fined up to Rs.5,000.
